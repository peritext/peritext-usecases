essential and this should be tackled, in part, by regularization efforts and an increase in legal pathways, and not by the criminalization and marginalization of irregular migrants, who are often the

It is crucial to keep in mind that most of the world’s 258 million migrants move in a completely regular fashion.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-8e2cb4b2-ca6b-4c3c-8ea3-4351a68f1e39"></span></div><div class="unstyled">Their economic impact and contribution to reducing inequalities between and among countries is well recognized in the Sustainable Development Goals.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-517edb18-f379-402c-bf73-12a097074698"></span></div><div class="unstyled">And, further: beyond its contribution to sustainable development, you yourselves know only too well migration’s utility as a tool to offset demographic trends of population growth or decline in many countries.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-994f660d-1703-4527-ab8f-36c5b03595fb"></span></div><div class="unstyled">Despite the many positive impacts of migration, current restrictive labour policies, coupled with other legal and practical barriers often hinder migrants’ potential to contribute fully  to our societies.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-ebcdc0a7-7180-4713-b073-188de8c31527"></span></div><div class="unstyled">In this regard, the Secretary-General urges Member States to open and diversify the various legal pathways for migration including as a tool to reduce irregular migration.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-4062805f-6b64-48c1-8357-cbf159b71c9a"></span></div><div class="unstyled">There are several advantages to such an approach. More legal avenues for migration will  reduce the incentives for individuals to enter or stay in a country irregularly, thereby protecting migrants from exploitation.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-c2bb46ac-3c56-4b23-8088-e14ba64619a2"></span></div><div class="unstyled">At the same time, a variety of open pathways will ensure that actual labour market needs for foreign workers in many countries are met, and not only in the informal economy, as is often the case today.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-85f6cd1a-52a4-4d51-9838-efee0c82e108"></span></div><div class="unstyled">The Secretary-General also highlights the situation of migrants in vulnerable situations, particularly those who, having tried to escape insecurity, human rights violations, environmental degradation, or general lack of opportunities, have undertaken a journey in perilous conditions, often as part of large population movements.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-b58eb423-adc5-4324-9679-7a4cc5384ec1"></span></div><div class="unstyled">For many of those, while asylum under the Refugee Convention is not an option, return is often also not realistic.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-c06fdd18-4725-4023-a6c0-3cc8a484ec66"></span></div><div class="unstyled">We are currently ill-equipped to address this issue, thus the need for increased international cooperation which should yield practical, sustainable and humane solutions for them.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-2c166fbd-32de-4b60-97fa-fcdc4911b8ee"></span></div><div class="unstyled">Finally, the report stresses the Secretary-General’s ambition to reconsider the working methods of  the  United Nations system on international migration in order to support the implementation of the global compact in the best possible way, in line with his proposed UN management reform and strengthening of the development system.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-64b14675-e0bb-43ee-981e-3dcbfcfd4c5a"></span></div><div class="unstyled">Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me now address a few elements I would like to highlight in the context of your discussion on migration data.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-6b22cd76-c102-4196-8cd0-feb2d5eb91e4"></span></div><div class="unstyled">The global compact should seek to launch  an era of implementation where real progress can be made on the many commitments already made to the tangible benefit of millions of individuals.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-4a2d50f1-fe12-4da6-ab10-da86551a7712"></span></div><div class="unstyled">I’m sure I don’t have to convince anyone in this room that well-managed migration policies must be evidence-based and informed by  the best data available.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-6838e8a4-9b71-4889-ba85-9fdbc0fb194b"></span></div><div class="unstyled">To this end, the global compact will need to be supported by an increased effort to invest in data collection, analysis and research, on the broadest possible thematic and  geographic basis.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-fcc2da88-9a61-4a4b-83e4-20dc87aabff5"></span></div><div class="unstyled">Availability of timely, disaggregated data is so crucial to the design of appropriate migration policies, both nationally and internationally.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-abc39e20-3172-492a-88ab-c4af2566661c"></span></div><div class="unstyled">Credible economic and social indicators are the best way to counteract myths and assumptions which cannot be the basis for  sound public policy.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-69d4b6fa-db70-4d69-a339-b007aabb8e89"></span></div><div class="unstyled">While more scientific evidence and research on international migration is clearly required, we must also acknowledge the current environment in which we will seek to deploy these efforts.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-2888e2bb-0736-4f59-a8a1-f64a4d9bceda"></span></div><div class="unstyled">There is an increase in public distrust towards government institutions in many countries, and privacy protection concerns are also rising.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-ddf9f988-b41f-4542-8009-777d0ca771a4"></span></div><div class="unstyled">It will be critical for the scientific community and for political leaders to stress the importance of data gathering exercises such as population censuses, and to reiterate the proper handling of  such information.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-6fccec27-0301-4171-bc05-626fc528929c"></span></div><div class="unstyled">I was particularly pleased to see that your deliberations include a panel supporting on-going endeavours to correct the narrative on international migration, while focusing on the existing tension between popular perception and the reality of migration: a reality which – as you all know – is much better than public rhetoric in many countries would suggest.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-ab1e7759-e123-4449-a717-002dd93f606c"></span></div><div class="unstyled">Finally, as outlined earlier, the compact should be viewed essentially as an agreement to cooperate.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-b51d84a8-b610-4502-b53a-a0d8d0c4aedf"></span></div><div class="unstyled">Success will largely depend on political leadership and the willingness of states to enhance cooperation, not only between themselves, but also in partnership with other stakeholders including civil society, academia and the scientific community, the private sector, and others.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-7086e9bd-e80a-4a14-8acc-4cf2a50feff7"></span></div><div class="unstyled">In this spirit of cooperation, I am delighted to see that your discussion focuses on capacity building and collaboration with a variety of stakeholders to explore innovative ideas to improve migration data.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-c2f2fe44-5904-445b-8a3b-86e062899756"></span></div><div class="unstyled">In closing, let me reiterate that the global compact process presents a unique opportunity to prioritize investments in data collection and research, and to mobilize resources and funding needed for a better understanding of all aspects of international migration.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-479270d6-0cc0-4e32-892e-6d3ae2d04e70"></span></div><div class="unstyled">I wish you all the best in your deliberations and I look forward to hearing the results of this splendid initiative.<span class="inline-contextualization-container video" id="contextualization-1653038f-6adf-4708-b2c1-c2b3e50968ef-956c80f5-f6db-47da-9f9a-3837b111cce0"></span></div></div></div></section>
