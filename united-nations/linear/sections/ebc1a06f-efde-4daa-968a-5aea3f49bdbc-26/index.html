Briefing the press at United Nations Headquarters in New York for the first time on November 3, 2017, the first-ever UN advocate for the rights of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse highlighted her role to give those who have suffered “visibility” and amplify their voices.

“I&#x27;m the first prong of the full-pronged strategy of the Secretary-General to address SEA [sexual exploitation and abuse] systemwide,” said Victims&#x27; Rights Advocate Jane Connors.

“My priority is to give visibility to those who have suffered, including through connecting with them personally, and I wish to amplify their voices in a way that cannot be ignored, and support them as they rebuild their lives,” added the Australian law professional and long-time human rights advocate.

Since taking up her responsibility as the UN advocate on 14 September, she has had various interactions, has met with representatives of countries, UN colleagues and other stakeholders and visited the Central African Republic (CAR) and South Sudan to meet with victims.

She said she works with field advocates in four locations – Haiti, CAR, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan – who have direct contact with these victims. In the future, other locations might be added.

Her appointment is in line with the Secretary-General&#x27;s pledge – made in his report on Special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and abuse: a new approach – that the UN will put the rights and dignity of victims at the forefront of its prevention and response efforts."/><meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no,width=device-width"/><meta name="twitter:card" value="summary"/><meta name="twitter:site" content=""/><meta name="twitter:title" content="United Nations transcripted youtube videos - Explainer: What is the UN Victims&#x27; Rights Advocate?"/><meta name="twitter:description" content="Learn more about the first United Nations Victims’ Rights Advocate (VRA), appointed by Secretary-General António Guterres as part of the UN’s response to sexual exploitation and abuse.
